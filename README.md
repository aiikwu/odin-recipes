# Odin Recipes

This is my project for **[The Odin Project - HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations)** where I will create a basic recipe website using HTML. This is a great opportunity to reinforce and showcase my what I've learned about HTML and project organization using Git.

## Features
- **HTML Boilerplate** - structuring a webpage properly
- **Working with Text** - using elements such as headings, paragraph, bold, italic, strong, and emphasis
- **Lists** - using ordered and unordered lists
- **Links and Images** - embedding links and images to a webpage 
- **Commit Messages** - following **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)**

## Iterations

### 1. Initial Structure
- Create a main index page

### 2. Recipe Page
- Set up a recipes directory
- Create a first recipe page and link to the main index page

### 3. Recipe Page Content
- Add content to the first recipe page using headings, pictures, and lists

### 4. Add More Recipes
- Create two more recipe pages with same page structure as the first recipe page
